# Mind My Plants

## About

_Mind My Plants_ was created as a collaborative [graduation project](https://northcoders.com/project-phase/mind-my-plants) for Northcoders' JavaScript Development Bootcamp (2024). It was design and implemented using Agile best practice with **Expo**/**React Native** and **NativeWind CSS** for the front end and **Oracle Apex** RESTFul services and **Firebase** for the back end.

The application implements a two-sided marketplace platform that enables plant owners and sitters to interact and arrange for plant sitting jobs.

### Owners can:

- add a list of plants they own together with specific care instructions
- advertise for plant sitting jobs
- choose from and confirm a job from a list of applications

### Sitters can:

- browse for a list of jobs and filter by location
- apply for an advertised job

Additionally, both parties can communicate with each other in real time using the in-built chat functionality.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo
